> **Project:** Governance Hub
> **Duration:** ~2 hours
> **Plan File:** `~/.claude/plans/sharded-tickling-moon.md`

## Summary

Completed Phase 2.5: DataStoragePlan → Governance reorganization, plus added Risk Analysis and refined governance rules.

## Key Decisions

| ID | Decision |
|----|----------|
| #G9 | DataStoragePlan/ → Governance/ (Phase 2.5 reorganization) |
| #G10 | Plan File Sync using checkbox `[x]` format |
| #G11 | Warm-Up Protocol: on task completion OR after 1 hour (hybrid) |

## What Was Done

### Risk Analysis Added
- Identified plan file staleness problem (TodoWrite vs plan file sync)
- Created 8-item Risk Register (R1-R8)
- Solution: Keep both in sync using checkbox format

### Phase 2.5: Governance Reorganization
1. Created `~/Desktop/Governance/` folder structure
2. Moved templates to `Governance/templates/`
3. Moved registry files to `Governance/registry/`
4. Moved original DataStoragePlan content to `Governance/DataStoragePlan/`
5. Updated all template footers with new paths
6. Added Plan File Sync rules (8-9) to all 4 templates
7. Updated scripts with new paths
8. Removed old DataStoragePlan/ folder

### New Rules Added to All Templates
```
8. **Plan File Sync:** Update plan file with `[x]` as tasks complete. Plan file = source of truth.
9. **Warm-Up Protocol:** On phase/task completion OR after 1 hour, update CONTEXT.md, SESSION_LOG.md, and plan file.
```

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `Governance/CLAUDE.md` | Complete restructure, added Plan File Sync + Warm-Up Protocol |
| `Governance/CONTEXT.md` | Updated title, added #G9-G11 |
| `Governance/SESSION_LOG.md` | Added session 3 entry |
| `Governance/templates/*.md` | Updated paths, added new rules |
| `Governance/scripts/*.sh` | Updated paths |
| `~/.claude/plans/sharded-tickling-moon.md` | Marked Phase 2.5 complete |

## Discussion Topics

1. **Risk of plan file staleness** - Solved with Plan File Sync rule
2. **DataStoragePlan name misleading** - Renamed to Governance
3. **Warm-Up Protocol trigger** - Changed from "every 1-2 hours" to hybrid: "on task completion OR after 1 hour"

## Next Steps

1. Wait for HD7 recovery (~5 days)
2. Phase 3: Project migrations (one at a time)
