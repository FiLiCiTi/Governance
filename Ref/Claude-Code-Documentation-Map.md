     # Get started with Claude Code hooks

     > Learn how to customize and extend Claude Code's behavior by registering shell commands

     Claude Code hooks are user-defined shell commands that execute at various points
     in Claude Code's lifecycle. Hooks provide deterministic control over Claude
     Code's behavior, ensuring certain actions always happen rather than relying on
     the LLM to choose to run them.

     <Tip>
       For reference documentation on hooks, see [Hooks reference](/en/hooks).
     </Tip>

     Example use cases for hooks include:

     * **Notifications**: Customize how you get notified when Claude Code is awaiting
       your input or permission to run something.
     * **Automatic formatting**: Run `prettier` on .ts files, `gofmt` on .go files,
       etc. after every file edit.
     * **Logging**: Track and count all executed commands for compliance or
       debugging.
     * **Feedback**: Provide automated feedback when Claude Code produces code that
       does not follow your codebase conventions.
     * **Custom permissions**: Block modifications to production files or sensitive
       directories.

     By encoding these rules as hooks rather than prompting instructions, you turn
     suggestions into app-level code that executes every time it is expected to run.

     <Warning>
       You must consider the security implication of hooks as you add them, because hooks run automatically during the agent loop with your current environment's credentials.
       For example, malicious hooks code can exfiltrate your data. Always review your hooks implementation before registering them.

       For full security best practices, see [Security Considerations](/en/hooks#security-considerations) in the hooks reference documentation.
     </Warning>

     ## Hook Events Overview

     Claude Code provides several hook events that run at different points in the
     workflow:

     * **PreToolUse**: Runs before tool calls (can block them)
     * **PermissionRequest**: Runs when a permission dialog is shown (can allow or deny)
     * **PostToolUse**: Runs after tool calls complete
     * **UserPromptSubmit**: Runs when the user submits a prompt, before Claude processes it
     * **Notification**: Runs when Claude Code sends notifications
     * **Stop**: Runs when Claude Code finishes responding
     * **SubagentStop**: Runs when subagent tasks complete
     * **PreCompact**: Runs before Claude Code is about to run a compact operation
     * **SessionStart**: Runs when Claude Code starts a new session or resumes an existing session
     * **SessionEnd**: Runs when Claude Code session ends

     Each event receives different data and can control Claude's behavior in
     different ways.

     ## Quickstart

     In this quickstart, you'll add a hook that logs the shell commands that Claude
     Code runs.

     ### Prerequisites

     Install `jq` for JSON processing in the command line.

     ### Step 1: Open hooks configuration

     Run the `/hooks` [slash command](/en/slash-commands) and select
     the `PreToolUse` hook event.

     `PreToolUse` hooks run before tool calls and can block them while providing
     Claude feedback on what to do differently.

     ### Step 2: Add a matcher

     Select `+ Add new matcher…` to run your hook only on Bash tool calls.

     Type `Bash` for the matcher.

     <Note>You can use `*` to match all tools.</Note>

     ### Step 3: Add the hook

     Select `+ Add new hook…` and enter this command:

     ```bash  theme={null}
     jq -r '"\(.tool_input.command) - \(.tool_input.description // "No description")"' >> ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt
     ```

     ### Step 4: Save your configuration

     For storage location, select `User settings` since you're logging to your home
     directory. This hook will then apply to all projects, not just your current
     project.

     Then press `Esc` until you return to the REPL. Your hook is now registered.

     ### Step 5: Verify your hook

     Run `/hooks` again or check `~/.claude/settings.json` to see your configuration:

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "hooks": {
         "PreToolUse": [
           {
             "matcher": "Bash",
             "hooks": [
               {
                 "type": "command",
                 "command": "jq -r '\"\\(.tool_input.command) - \\(.tool_input.description // \"No description\")\"' >> ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt"
               }
             ]
           }
         ]
       }
     }
     ```

     ### Step 6: Test your hook

     Ask Claude to run a simple command like `ls` and check your log file:

     ```bash  theme={null}
     cat ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt
     ```

     You should see entries like:

     ```
     ls - Lists files and directories
     ```

     ## More Examples

     <Note>
       For a complete example implementation, see the [bash command validator example](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/examples/hooks/bash_command_validator_example.py) in our public
      codebase.
     </Note>

     ### Code Formatting Hook

     Automatically format TypeScript files after editing:

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "hooks": {
         "PostToolUse": [
           {
             "matcher": "Edit|Write",
             "hooks": [
               {
                 "type": "command",
                 "command": "jq -r '.tool_input.file_path' | { read file_path; if echo \"$file_path\" | grep -q '\\.ts$'; then npx prettier --write \"$file_path\"; fi; }"
               }
             ]
           }
         ]
       }
     }
     ```

     ### Markdown Formatting Hook

     Automatically fix missing language tags and formatting issues in markdown files:

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "hooks": {
         "PostToolUse": [
           {
             "matcher": "Edit|Write",
             "hooks": [
               {
                 "type": "command",

     Make the script executable:

     ```bash  theme={null}
     chmod +x .claude/hooks/markdown_formatter.py

     This hook automatically:

     * Detects programming languages in unlabeled code blocks
     * Adds appropriate language tags for syntax highlighting
     * Fixes excessive blank lines while preserving code content
     * Only processes markdown files (`.md`, `.mdx`)

     ### Custom Notification Hook

     Get desktop notifications when Claude needs input:

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "hooks": {
         "Notification": [
           {
             "matcher": "",
             "hooks": [
               {
                 "type": "command",
                 "command": "notify-send 'Claude Code' 'Awaiting your input'"
               }
             ]
           }
         ]
       }
     }
     ```

     ### File Protection Hook

     Block edits to sensitive files:

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "hooks": {
         "PreToolUse": [
           {
             "matcher": "Edit|Write",
             "hooks": [
               {
                 "type": "command",
                 "command": "python3 -c \"import json, sys; data=json.load(sys.stdin); path=data.get('tool_input',{}).get('file_path',''); sys.exit(2 if any(p in path for p in ['.env',
     'package-lock.json', '.git/']) else 0)\""
               }
             ]
           }
         ]
       }
     }
     ```

     # Hooks reference

     > This page provides reference documentation for implementing hooks in Claude Code.

     <Tip>
       For a quickstart guide with examples, see [Get started with Claude Code hooks](/en/hooks-guide).
     </Tip>

     ## Configuration

     Claude Code hooks are configured in your [settings files](/en/settings):

     * `~/.claude/settings.json` - User settings
     * `.claude/settings.json` - Project settings
     * `.claude/settings.local.json` - Local project settings (not committed)
     * Enterprise managed policy settings

     <Note>
       Enterprise administrators can use `allowManagedHooksOnly` to block user, project, and plugin hooks. See [Hook configuration](/en/settings#hook-configuration).
     </Note>

     ### Structure

     Hooks are organized by matchers, where each matcher can have multiple hooks:

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "hooks": {
         "EventName": [
           {
             "matcher": "ToolPattern",
             "hooks": [
               {
                 "type": "command",
                 "command": "your-command-here"
               }
             ]
           }
         ]
       }
     }
     ```

     * **matcher**: Pattern to match tool names, case-sensitive (only applicable for
       `PreToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, and `PostToolUse`)
       * Simple strings match exactly: `Write` matches only the Write tool
       * Supports regex: `Edit|Write` or `Notebook.*`
       * Use `*` to match all tools. You can also use empty string (`""`) or leave
         `matcher` blank.
     * **hooks**: Array of hooks to execute when the pattern matches
       * `type`: Hook execution type - `"command"` for bash commands or `"prompt"` for LLM-based evaluation
       * `command`: (For `type: "command"`) The bash command to execute (can use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable)
       * `prompt`: (For `type: "prompt"`) The prompt to send to the LLM for evaluation
       * `timeout`: (Optional) How long a hook should run, in seconds, before canceling that specific hook

     For events like `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, and `SubagentStop`
     that don't use matchers, you can omit the matcher field:

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "hooks": {
         "UserPromptSubmit": [
           {
             "hooks": [
               {
                 "type": "command",
                 "command": "/path/to/prompt-validator.py"
               }
             ]
           }
         ]
       }
     }
     ```

     ### Project-Specific Hook Scripts

     You can use the environment variable `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (only available when
     Claude Code spawns the hook command) to reference scripts stored in your project,
     ensuring they work regardless of Claude's current directory:

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "hooks": {
         "PostToolUse": [
           {
             "matcher": "Write|Edit",
             "hooks": [
               {
                 "type": "command",
                 "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/check-style.sh"
               }
             ]
           }
         ]
       }
     }
     ```

     ### Plugin hooks

     [Plugins](/en/plugins) can provide hooks that integrate seamlessly with your user and project hooks. Plugin hooks are automatically merged with your configuration when plugins are enabled.

     **How plugin hooks work**:

     * Plugin hooks are defined in the plugin's `hooks/hooks.json` file or in a file given by a custom path to the `hooks` field.
     * When a plugin is enabled, its hooks are merged with user and project hooks
     * Multiple hooks from different sources can respond to the same event
     * Plugin hooks use the `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` environment variable to reference plugin files

     **Example plugin hook configuration**:

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "description": "Automatic code formatting",
       "hooks": {
         "PostToolUse": [
           {
             "matcher": "Write|Edit",
             "hooks": [
               {
                 "type": "command",
                 "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/format.sh",
                 "timeout": 30
               }
             ]
           }
         ]
       }
     }
     ```

     <Note>
       Plugin hooks use the same format as regular hooks with an optional `description` field to explain the hook's purpose.
     </Note>

     <Note>
       Plugin hooks run alongside your custom hooks. If multiple hooks match an event, they all execute in parallel.
     </Note>

     **Environment variables for plugins**:

     * `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`: Absolute path to the plugin directory
     * `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}`: Project root directory (same as for project hooks)
     * All standard environment variables are available

     See the [plugin components reference](/en/plugins-reference#hooks) for details on creating plugin hooks.

     ## Prompt-Based Hooks

     In addition to bash command hooks (`type: "command"`), Claude Code supports prompt-based hooks (`type: "prompt"`) that use an LLM to evaluate whether to allow or block an action. Prompt-based hooks
      are currently only supported for `Stop` and `SubagentStop` hooks, where they enable intelligent, context-aware decisions.

     ### How prompt-based hooks work

     Instead of executing a bash command, prompt-based hooks:

     1. Send the hook input and your prompt to a fast LLM (Haiku)
     2. The LLM responds with structured JSON containing a decision
     3. Claude Code processes the decision automatically

     ### Configuration

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "hooks": {
         "Stop": [
           {
             "hooks": [
               {
                 "type": "prompt",
                 "prompt": "Evaluate if Claude should stop: $ARGUMENTS. Check if all tasks are complete."
               }
             ]
           }
         ]
       }
     }
     ```

     **Fields:**

     * `type`: Must be `"prompt"`
     * `prompt`: The prompt text to send to the LLM
       * Use `$ARGUMENTS` as a placeholder for the hook input JSON
       * If `$ARGUMENTS` is not present, input JSON is appended to the prompt
     * `timeout`: (Optional) Timeout in seconds (default: 30 seconds)

     ### Response schema

     The LLM must respond with JSON containing:

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "decision": "approve" | "block",
       "reason": "Explanation for the decision",
       "continue": false,  // Optional: stops Claude entirely
       "stopReason": "Message shown to user",  // Optional: custom stop message
       "systemMessage": "Warning or context"  // Optional: shown to user
     }
     ```

     **Response fields:**

     * `decision`: `"approve"` allows the action, `"block"` prevents it
     * `reason`: Explanation shown to Claude when decision is `"block"`
     * `continue`: (Optional) If `false`, stops Claude's execution entirely
     * `stopReason`: (Optional) Message shown when `continue` is false
     * `systemMessage`: (Optional) Additional message shown to the user

     ### Supported hook events

     Prompt-based hooks work with any hook event, but are most useful for:

     * **Stop**: Intelligently decide if Claude should continue working
     * **SubagentStop**: Evaluate if a subagent has completed its task
     * **UserPromptSubmit**: Validate user prompts with LLM assistance
     * **PreToolUse**: Make context-aware permission decisions
     * **PermissionRequest**: Intelligently allow or deny permission dialogs

     ### Example: Intelligent Stop hook

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "hooks": {
         "Stop": [
           {
             "hooks": [
               {
                 "type": "prompt",
                 "prompt": "You are evaluating whether Claude should stop working. Context: $ARGUMENTS\n\nAnalyze the conversation and determine if:\n1. All user-requested tasks are complete\n2. Any
     errors need to be addressed\n3. Follow-up work is needed\n\nRespond with JSON: {\"decision\": \"approve\" or \"block\", \"reason\": \"your explanation\"}",
                 "timeout": 30
               }
             ]
           }
         ]
       }
     }
     ```

     ### Example: SubagentStop with custom logic

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "hooks": {
         "SubagentStop": [
           {
             "hooks": [
               {
                 "type": "prompt",
                 "prompt": "Evaluate if this subagent should stop. Input: $ARGUMENTS\n\nCheck if:\n- The subagent completed its assigned task\n- Any errors occurred that need fixing\n- Additional
     context gathering is needed\n\nReturn: {\"decision\": \"approve\" or \"block\", \"reason\": \"explanation\"}"
               }
             ]
           }
         ]
       }
     }
     ```

     ### Comparison with bash command hooks

     | Feature               | Bash Command Hooks      | Prompt-Based Hooks             |
     | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
     | **Execution**         | Runs bash script        | Queries LLM                    |
     | **Decision logic**    | You implement in code   | LLM evaluates context          |
     | **Setup complexity**  | Requires script file    | Configure prompt               |
     | **Context awareness** | Limited to script logic | Natural language understanding |
     | **Performance**       | Fast (local execution)  | Slower (API call)              |
     | **Use case**          | Deterministic rules     | Context-aware decisions        |

     ### Best practices

     * **Be specific in prompts**: Clearly state what you want the LLM to evaluate
     * **Include decision criteria**: List the factors the LLM should consider
     * **Test your prompts**: Verify the LLM makes correct decisions for your use cases
     * **Set appropriate timeouts**: Default is 30 seconds, adjust if needed
     * **Use for complex decisions**: Bash hooks are better for simple, deterministic rules

     See the [plugin components reference](/en/plugins-reference#hooks) for details on creating plugin hooks.

     ## Hook Events

     ### PreToolUse

     Runs after Claude creates tool parameters and before processing the tool call.

     **Common matchers:**

     * `Task` - Subagent tasks (see [subagents documentation](/en/sub-agents))
     * `Bash` - Shell commands
     * `Glob` - File pattern matching
     * `Grep` - Content search
     * `Read` - File reading
     * `Edit` - File editing
     * `Write` - File writing
     * `WebFetch`, `WebSearch` - Web operations

     Use [PreToolUse decision control](#pretooluse-decision-control) to allow, deny, or ask for permission to use the tool.

     ### PermissionRequest

     Runs when the user is shown a permission dialog.
     Use [PermissionRequest decision control](#permissionrequest-decision-control) to allow or deny on behalf of the user.

     Recognizes the same matcher values as PreToolUse.

     ### PostToolUse

     Runs immediately after a tool completes successfully.

     Recognizes the same matcher values as PreToolUse.

     ### Notification

     Runs when Claude Code sends notifications. Supports matchers to filter by notification type.

     **Common matchers:**

     * `permission_prompt` - Permission requests from Claude Code
     * `idle_prompt` - When Claude is waiting for user input (after 60+ seconds of idle time)
     * `auth_success` - Authentication success notifications
     * `elicitation_dialog` - When Claude Code needs input for MCP tool elicitation

     You can use matchers to run different hooks for different notification types, or omit the matcher to run hooks for all notifications.

     **Example: Different notifications for different types**

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "hooks": {
         "Notification": [
           {
             "matcher": "permission_prompt",
             "hooks": [
               {
                 "type": "command",
                 "command": "/path/to/permission-alert.sh"
               }
             ]
           },
           {
             "matcher": "idle_prompt",
             "hooks": [
               {
                 "type": "command",
                 "command": "/path/to/idle-notification.sh"
               }
             ]
           }
         ]
       }
     }
     ```

     ### UserPromptSubmit

     Runs when the user submits a prompt, before Claude processes it. This allows you
     to add additional context based on the prompt/conversation, validate prompts, or
     block certain types of prompts.

     ### Stop

     Runs when the main Claude Code agent has finished responding. Does not run if
     the stoppage occurred due to a user interrupt.

     ### SubagentStop

     Runs when a Claude Code subagent (Task tool call) has finished responding.

     ### PreCompact

     Runs before Claude Code is about to run a compact operation.

     **Matchers:**

     * `manual` - Invoked from `/compact`
     * `auto` - Invoked from auto-compact (due to full context window)

     ### SessionStart

     Runs when Claude Code starts a new session or resumes an existing session (which
     currently does start a new session under the hood). Useful for loading in
     development context like existing issues or recent changes to your codebase, installing dependencies, or setting up environment variables.

     **Matchers:**

     * `startup` - Invoked from startup
     * `resume` - Invoked from `--resume`, `--continue`, or `/resume`
     * `clear` - Invoked from `/clear`
     * `compact` - Invoked from auto or manual compact.

     #### Persisting environment variables

     SessionStart hooks have access to the `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` environment variable, which provides a file path where you can persist environment variables for subsequent bash commands.

     **Example: Setting individual environment variables**

     ```bash  theme={null}
     #!/bin/bash

     if [ -n "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE" ]; then
       echo 'export NODE_ENV=production' >> "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE"
       echo 'export API_KEY=your-api-key' >> "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE"
       echo 'export PATH="$PATH:./node_modules/.bin"' >> "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE"
     fi

     exit 0
     ```

     **Example: Persisting all environment changes from the hook**

     When your setup modifies the environment (for example, `nvm use`), capture and persist all changes by diffing the environment:

     ```bash  theme={null}
     #!/bin/bash

     ENV_BEFORE=$(export -p | sort)

     # Run your setup commands that modify the environment
     source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
     nvm use 20

     if [ -n "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE" ]; then
       ENV_AFTER=$(export -p | sort)
       comm -13 <(echo "$ENV_BEFORE") <(echo "$ENV_AFTER") >> "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE"
     fi

     exit 0
     ```

     Any variables written to this file will be available in all subsequent bash commands that Claude Code executes during the session.

     <Note>
       `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` is only available for SessionStart hooks. Other hook types do not have access to this variable.
     </Note>

     ### SessionEnd

     Runs when a Claude Code session ends. Useful for cleanup tasks, logging session
     statistics, or saving session state.

     The `reason` field in the hook input will be one of:

     * `clear` - Session cleared with /clear command
     * `logout` - User logged out
     * `prompt_input_exit` - User exited while prompt input was visible
     * `other` - Other exit reasons

     ## Hook Input

     Hooks receive JSON data via stdin containing session information and
     event-specific data:

     ```typescript  theme={null}
     {
       // Common fields
       session_id: string
       transcript_path: string  // Path to conversation JSON
       cwd: string              // The current working directory when the hook is invoked
       permission_mode: string  // Current permission mode: "default", "plan", "acceptEdits", or "bypassPermissions"

       // Event-specific fields
       hook_event_name: string
       ...
     }
     ```

     ### PreToolUse Input

     The exact schema for `tool_input` depends on the tool.

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "session_id": "abc123",
       "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
       "cwd": "/Users/...",
       "permission_mode": "default",
       "hook_event_name": "PreToolUse",
       "tool_name": "Write",
       "tool_input": {
         "file_path": "/path/to/file.txt",
         "content": "file content"
       },
       "tool_use_id": "toolu_01ABC123..."
     }
     ```

     ### PostToolUse Input

     The exact schema for `tool_input` and `tool_response` depends on the tool.

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "session_id": "abc123",
       "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
       "cwd": "/Users/...",
       "permission_mode": "default",
       "hook_event_name": "PostToolUse",
       "tool_name": "Write",
       "tool_input": {
         "file_path": "/path/to/file.txt",
         "content": "file content"
       },
       "tool_response": {
         "filePath": "/path/to/file.txt",
         "success": true
       },
       "tool_use_id": "toolu_01ABC123..."
     }
     ```

     ### Notification Input

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "session_id": "abc123",
       "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
       "cwd": "/Users/...",
       "permission_mode": "default",
       "hook_event_name": "Notification",
       "message": "Claude needs your permission to use Bash",
       "notification_type": "permission_prompt"
     }
     ```

     ### UserPromptSubmit Input

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "session_id": "abc123",
       "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
       "cwd": "/Users/...",
       "permission_mode": "default",
       "hook_event_name": "UserPromptSubmit",
       "prompt": "Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number"
     }
     ```

     ### Stop and SubagentStop Input

     `stop_hook_active` is true when Claude Code is already continuing as a result of
     a stop hook. Check this value or process the transcript to prevent Claude Code
     from running indefinitely.

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "session_id": "abc123",
       "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
       "permission_mode": "default",
       "hook_event_name": "Stop",
       "stop_hook_active": true
     }
     ```

     ### PreCompact Input

     For `manual`, `custom_instructions` comes from what the user passes into
     `/compact`. For `auto`, `custom_instructions` is empty.

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "session_id": "abc123",
       "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
       "permission_mode": "default",
       "hook_event_name": "PreCompact",
       "trigger": "manual",
       "custom_instructions": ""
     }
     ```

     ### SessionStart Input

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "session_id": "abc123",
       "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
       "permission_mode": "default",
       "hook_event_name": "SessionStart",
       "source": "startup"
     }
     ```

     ### SessionEnd Input

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "session_id": "abc123",
       "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
       "cwd": "/Users/...",
       "permission_mode": "default",
       "hook_event_name": "SessionEnd",
       "reason": "exit"
     }
     ```

     ## Hook Output

     There are two mutually exclusive ways for hooks to return output back to Claude Code. The output
     communicates whether to block and any feedback that should be shown to Claude
     and the user.

     ### Simple: Exit Code

     Hooks communicate status through exit codes, stdout, and stderr:

     * **Exit code 0**: Success. `stdout` is shown to the user in verbose mode
       (ctrl+o), except for `UserPromptSubmit` and `SessionStart`, where stdout is
       added to the context. JSON output in `stdout` is parsed for structured control
       (see [Advanced: JSON Output](#advanced-json-output)).
     * **Exit code 2**: Blocking error. Only `stderr` is used as the error message
       and fed back to Claude. The format is `[command]: {stderr}`. JSON in `stdout`
       is **not** processed for exit code 2. See per-hook-event behavior below.
     * **Other exit codes**: Non-blocking error. `stderr` is shown to the user in verbose mode (ctrl+o) with
       format `Failed with non-blocking status code: {stderr}`. If `stderr` is empty,
       it shows `No stderr output`. Execution continues.

     <Warning>
       Reminder: Claude Code does not see stdout if the exit code is 0, except for
       the `UserPromptSubmit` hook where stdout is injected as context.
     </Warning>

     #### Exit Code 2 Behavior

     | Hook Event          | Behavior                                                           |
     | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
     | `PreToolUse`        | Blocks the tool call, shows stderr to Claude                       |
     | `PermissionRequest` | Denies the permission, shows stderr to Claude                      |
     | `PostToolUse`       | Shows stderr to Claude (tool already ran)                          |
     | `Notification`      | N/A, shows stderr to user only                                     |
     | `UserPromptSubmit`  | Blocks prompt processing, erases prompt, shows stderr to user only |
     | `Stop`              | Blocks stoppage, shows stderr to Claude                            |
     | `SubagentStop`      | Blocks stoppage, shows stderr to Claude subagent                   |
     | `PreCompact`        | N/A, shows stderr to user only                                     |
     | `SessionStart`      | N/A, shows stderr to user only                                     |
     | `SessionEnd`        | N/A, shows stderr to user only                                     |

     ### Advanced: JSON Output

     Hooks can return structured JSON in `stdout` for more sophisticated control.

     <Warning>
       JSON output is only processed when the hook exits with code 0. If your hook
       exits with code 2 (blocking error), `stderr` text is used directly—any JSON in `stdout`
       is ignored. For other non-zero exit codes, only `stderr` is shown to the user in verbose mode (ctrl+o).
     </Warning>

     #### Common JSON Fields

     All hook types can include these optional fields:

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "continue": true, // Whether Claude should continue after hook execution (default: true)
       "stopReason": "string", // Message shown when continue is false

       "suppressOutput": true, // Hide stdout from transcript mode (default: false)
       "systemMessage": "string" // Optional warning message shown to the user
     }
     ```

     If `continue` is false, Claude stops processing after the hooks run.

     * For `PreToolUse`, this is different from `"permissionDecision": "deny"`, which
       only blocks a specific tool call and provides automatic feedback to Claude.
     * For `PostToolUse`, this is different from `"decision": "block"`, which
       provides automated feedback to Claude.
     * For `UserPromptSubmit`, this prevents the prompt from being processed.
     * For `Stop` and `SubagentStop`, this takes precedence over any
       `"decision": "block"` output.
     * In all cases, `"continue" = false` takes precedence over any
       `"decision": "block"` output.

     `stopReason` accompanies `continue` with a reason shown to the user, not shown
     to Claude.

     #### `PreToolUse` Decision Control

     `PreToolUse` hooks can control whether a tool call proceeds.

     * `"allow"` bypasses the permission system. `permissionDecisionReason` is shown
       to the user but not to Claude.
     * `"deny"` prevents the tool call from executing. `permissionDecisionReason` is
       shown to Claude.
     * `"ask"` asks the user to confirm the tool call in the UI.
       `permissionDecisionReason` is shown to the user but not to Claude.

     Additionally, hooks can modify tool inputs before execution using `updatedInput`:

     * `updatedInput` allows you to modify the tool's input parameters before the tool executes.
     * This is most useful with `"permissionDecision": "allow"` to modify and approve tool calls.

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "hookSpecificOutput": {
         "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
         "permissionDecision": "allow"
         "permissionDecisionReason": "My reason here",
         "updatedInput": {
           "field_to_modify": "new value"
         }
       }
     }
     ```

     <Note>
       The `decision` and `reason` fields are deprecated for PreToolUse hooks.
       Use `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision` and
       `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecisionReason` instead. The deprecated fields
       `"approve"` and `"block"` map to `"allow"` and `"deny"` respectively.
     </Note>

     #### `PermissionRequest` Decision Control

     `PermissionRequest` hooks can allow or deny permission requests shown to the user.

     * For `"behavior": "allow"` you can also optionally pass in an `"updatedInput"` that modifies the tool's input parameters before the tool executes.
     * For `"behavior": "deny"` you can also optionally pass in a `"message"` string that tells the model why the permission was denied, and a boolean `"interrupt"` which will stop Claude.

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "hookSpecificOutput": {
         "hookEventName": "PermissionRequest",
         "decision": {
           "behavior": "allow",
           "updatedInput": {
             "command": "npm run lint"
           }
         }
       }
     }
     ```

     #### `PostToolUse` Decision Control

     `PostToolUse` hooks can provide feedback to Claude after tool execution.

     * `"block"` automatically prompts Claude with `reason`.
     * `undefined` does nothing. `reason` is ignored.
     * `"hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext"` adds context for Claude to consider.

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "decision": "block" | undefined,
       "reason": "Explanation for decision",
       "hookSpecificOutput": {
         "hookEventName": "PostToolUse",
         "additionalContext": "Additional information for Claude"
       }
     }
     ```

     #### `UserPromptSubmit` Decision Control

     `UserPromptSubmit` hooks can control whether a user prompt is processed and add context.

     **Adding context (exit code 0):**
     There are two ways to add context to the conversation:

     1. **Plain text stdout** (simpler): Any non-JSON text written to stdout is added
        as context. This is the easiest way to inject information.

     2. **JSON with `additionalContext`** (structured): Use the JSON format below for
        more control. The `additionalContext` field is added as context.

     Both methods work with exit code 0. Plain stdout is shown as hook output in
     the transcript; `additionalContext` is added more discretely.

     **Blocking prompts:**

     * `"decision": "block"` prevents the prompt from being processed. The submitted
       prompt is erased from context. `"reason"` is shown to the user but not added
       to context.
     * `"decision": undefined` (or omitted) allows the prompt to proceed normally.

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "decision": "block" | undefined,
       "reason": "Explanation for decision",
       "hookSpecificOutput": {
         "hookEventName": "UserPromptSubmit",
         "additionalContext": "My additional context here"
       }
     }
     ```

     <Note>
       The JSON format isn't required for simple use cases. To add context, you can print plain text to stdout with exit code 0. Use JSON when you need to
       block prompts or want more structured control.
     </Note>

     #### `Stop`/`SubagentStop` Decision Control

     `Stop` and `SubagentStop` hooks can control whether Claude must continue.

     * `"block"` prevents Claude from stopping. You must populate `reason` for Claude
       to know how to proceed.
     * `undefined` allows Claude to stop. `reason` is ignored.

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "decision": "block" | undefined,
       "reason": "Must be provided when Claude is blocked from stopping"
     }
     ```

     #### `SessionStart` Decision Control

     `SessionStart` hooks allow you to load in context at the start of a session.

     * `"hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext"` adds the string to the context.
     * Multiple hooks' `additionalContext` values are concatenated.

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "hookSpecificOutput": {
         "hookEventName": "SessionStart",
         "additionalContext": "My additional context here"
       }
     }
     ```

     #### `SessionEnd` Decision Control

     `SessionEnd` hooks run when a session ends. They cannot block session termination
     but can perform cleanup tasks.

     #### Exit Code Example: Bash Command Validation

     ```python  theme={null}
     #!/usr/bin/env python3
     import json
     import re
     import sys

     # Define validation rules as a list of (regex pattern, message) tuples
     VALIDATION_RULES = [
         (
             r"\bgrep\b(?!.*\|)",
             "Use 'rg' (ripgrep) instead of 'grep' for better performance and features",
         ),
         (
             r"\bfind\s+\S+\s+-name\b",
             "Use 'rg --files | rg pattern' or 'rg --files -g pattern' instead of 'find -name' for better performance",
         ),
     ]


     def validate_command(command: str) -> list[str]:
         issues = []
         for pattern, message in VALIDATION_RULES:
             if re.search(pattern, command):
                 issues.append(message)
         return issues


     try:
         input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)
     except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
         print(f"Error: Invalid JSON input: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
         sys.exit(1)

     tool_name = input_data.get("tool_name", "")
     tool_input = input_data.get("tool_input", {})
     command = tool_input.get("command", "")

     if tool_name != "Bash" or not command:
         sys.exit(1)

     # Validate the command
     issues = validate_command(command)

     if issues:
         for message in issues:
             print(f"• {message}", file=sys.stderr)
         # Exit code 2 blocks tool call and shows stderr to Claude
         sys.exit(2)
     ```

     #### JSON Output Example: UserPromptSubmit to Add Context and Validation

     <Note>
       For `UserPromptSubmit` hooks, you can inject context using either method:

       * **Plain text stdout** with exit code 0: Simplest approach, prints text
       * **JSON output** with exit code 0: Use `"decision": "block"` to reject prompts,
         or `additionalContext` for structured context injection

       Remember: Exit code 2 only uses `stderr` for the error message. To block using
       JSON (with a custom reason), use `"decision": "block"` with exit code 0.
     </Note>

     ```python  theme={null}
     #!/usr/bin/env python3
     import json
     import sys
     import re
     import datetime

     # Load input from stdin
     try:
         input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)
     except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
         print(f"Error: Invalid JSON input: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
         sys.exit(1)

     prompt = input_data.get("prompt", "")

     # Check for sensitive patterns
     sensitive_patterns = [
         (r"(?i)\b(password|secret|key|token)\s*[:=]", "Prompt contains potential secrets"),
     ]

     for pattern, message in sensitive_patterns:
         if re.search(pattern, prompt):
             # Use JSON output to block with a specific reason
             output = {
                 "decision": "block",
                 "reason": f"Security policy violation: {message}. Please rephrase your request without sensitive information."
             }
             print(json.dumps(output))
             sys.exit(0)

     # Add current time to context
     context = f"Current time: {datetime.datetime.now()}"
     print(context)

     """
     The following is also equivalent:
     print(json.dumps({
       "hookSpecificOutput": {
         "hookEventName": "UserPromptSubmit",
         "additionalContext": context,
       },
     }))
     """

     # Allow the prompt to proceed with the additional context
     sys.exit(0)
     ```

     #### JSON Output Example: PreToolUse with Approval

     ```python  theme={null}
     #!/usr/bin/env python3
     import json
     import sys

     # Load input from stdin
     try:
         input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)
     except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
         print(f"Error: Invalid JSON input: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
         sys.exit(1)

     tool_name = input_data.get("tool_name", "")
     tool_input = input_data.get("tool_input", {})

     # Example: Auto-approve file reads for documentation files
     if tool_name == "Read":
         file_path = tool_input.get("file_path", "")
         if file_path.endswith((".md", ".mdx", ".txt", ".json")):
             # Use JSON output to auto-approve the tool call
             output = {
                 "decision": "approve",
                 "reason": "Documentation file auto-approved",
                 "suppressOutput": True  # Don't show in verbose mode
             }
             print(json.dumps(output))
             sys.exit(0)

     # For other cases, let the normal permission flow proceed
     sys.exit(0)
     ```

     ## Working with MCP Tools

     Claude Code hooks work seamlessly with
     [Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools](/en/mcp). When MCP servers
     provide tools, they appear with a special naming pattern that you can match in
     your hooks.

     ### MCP Tool Naming

     MCP tools follow the pattern `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, for example:

     * `mcp__memory__create_entities` - Memory server's create entities tool
     * `mcp__filesystem__read_file` - Filesystem server's read file tool
     * `mcp__github__search_repositories` - GitHub server's search tool

     ### Configuring Hooks for MCP Tools

     You can target specific MCP tools or entire MCP servers:

     ```json  theme={null}
     {
       "hooks": {
         "PreToolUse": [
           {
             "matcher": "mcp__memory__.*",
             "hooks": [
               {
                 "type": "command",
                 "command": "echo 'Memory operation initiated' >> ~/mcp-operations.log"
               }
             ]
           },
           {
             "matcher": "mcp__.*__write.*",
             "hooks": [
               {
                 "type": "command",
                 "command": "/home/user/scripts/validate-mcp-write.py"
               }
             ]
           }
         ]
       }
     }
     ```

     ## Examples

     <Tip>
       For practical examples including code formatting, notifications, and file protection, see [More Examples](/en/hooks-guide#more-examples) in the get started guide.
     </Tip>

     ## Security Considerations

     ### Disclaimer

     **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**: Claude Code hooks execute arbitrary shell commands on
     your system automatically. By using hooks, you acknowledge that:

     * You are solely responsible for the commands you configure
     * Hooks can modify, delete, or access any files your user account can access
     * Malicious or poorly written hooks can cause data loss or system damage
     * Anthropic provides no warranty and assumes no liability for any damages
       resulting from hook usage
     * You should thoroughly test hooks in a safe environment before production use

     Always review and understand any hook commands before adding them to your
     configuration.

     ### Security Best Practices

     Here are some key practices for writing more secure hooks:

     1. **Validate and sanitize inputs** - Never trust input data blindly
     2. **Always quote shell variables** - Use `"$VAR"` not `$VAR`
     3. **Block path traversal** - Check for `..` in file paths
     4. **Use absolute paths** - Specify full paths for scripts (use
        "\$CLAUDE\_PROJECT\_DIR" for the project path)
     5. **Skip sensitive files** - Avoid `.env`, `.git/`, keys, etc.

     ### Configuration Safety

     Direct edits to hooks in settings files don't take effect immediately. Claude
     Code:

     1. Captures a snapshot of hooks at startup
     2. Uses this snapshot throughout the session
     3. Warns if hooks are modified externally
     4. Requires review in `/hooks` menu for changes to apply

     This prevents malicious hook modifications from affecting your current session.

     ## Hook Execution Details

     * **Timeout**: 60-second execution limit by default, configurable per command.
       * A timeout for an individual command does not affect the other commands.
     * **Parallelization**: All matching hooks run in parallel
     * **Deduplication**: Multiple identical hook commands are deduplicated automatically
     * **Environment**: Runs in current directory with Claude Code's environment
       * The `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable is available and contains the
         absolute path to the project root directory (where Claude Code was started)
       * The `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` environment variable indicates whether the hook is running in a remote (web) environment (`"true"`) or local CLI environment (not set or empty). Use this to run
     different logic based on execution context.
     * **Input**: JSON via stdin
     * **Output**:
       * PreToolUse/PermissionRequest/PostToolUse/Stop/SubagentStop: Progress shown in verbose mode (ctrl+o)
       * Notification/SessionEnd: Logged to debug only (`--debug`)
       * UserPromptSubmit/SessionStart: stdout added as context for Claude

     ## Debugging

     ### Basic Troubleshooting

     If your hooks aren't working:

     1. **Check configuration** - Run `/hooks` to see if your hook is registered
     2. **Verify syntax** - Ensure your JSON settings are valid
     3. **Test commands** - Run hook commands manually first
     4. **Check permissions** - Make sure scripts are executable
     5. **Review logs** - Use `claude --debug` to see hook execution details

     Common issues:

     * **Quotes not escaped** - Use `\"` inside JSON strings
     * **Wrong matcher** - Check tool names match exactly (case-sensitive)
     * **Command not found** - Use full paths for scripts

     ### Advanced Debugging

     For complex hook issues:

     1. **Inspect hook execution** - Use `claude --debug` to see detailed hook
        execution
     2. **Validate JSON schemas** - Test hook input/output with external tools
     3. **Check environment variables** - Verify Claude Code's environment is correct
     4. **Test edge cases** - Try hooks with unusual file paths or inputs
     5. **Monitor system resources** - Check for resource exhaustion during hook
        execution
     6. **Use structured logging** - Implement logging in your hook scripts

     ### Debug Output Example

     Use `claude --debug` to see hook execution details:

     ```
     [DEBUG] Executing hooks for PostToolUse:Write
     [DEBUG] Getting matching hook commands for PostToolUse with query: Write
     [DEBUG] Found 1 hook matchers in settings
     [DEBUG] Matched 1 hooks for query "Write"
     [DEBUG] Found 1 hook commands to execute
     [DEBUG] Executing hook command: <Your command> with timeout 60000ms
     [DEBUG] Hook command completed with status 0: <Your stdout>
     ```

     Progress messages appear in verbose mode (ctrl+o) showing:

     * Which hook is running
     * Command being executed
     * Success/failure status
     * Output or error messages

  ⎿  Response:
       Excellent! I now have comprehensive documentation about Claude Code hooks. Let me compile the research findings for you.

       Claude Code Hooks Research Summary

       Yes, Claude Code fully supports custom hooks. Here's the complete breakdown:

       1. Does Claude Code Support Custom Hooks?

       Yes, Claude Code has a robust hooks system that allows you to register shell commands or LLM-based prompts that execute at various points in the Claude Code lifecycle.

       2. Available Hook Types (Events)

       Claude Code supports 10 hook events:

       | Hook Event        | Purpose                         | Capabilities                                      |
       |-------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
       | PreToolUse        | Runs BEFORE tool calls          | Block/allow/modify tool calls, ask for permission |
       | PermissionRequest | When permission dialog shows    | Allow or deny on behalf of user                   |
       | PostToolUse       | AFTER tools complete            | Provide feedback to Claude                        |
       | UserPromptSubmit  | User submits prompt             | Add context, block/validate prompts               |
       | Notification      | When Claude sends notifications | Custom notifications (desktop alerts, etc.)       |
       | Stop              | When Claude finishes responding | Intelligently decide if Claude should continue    |
       | SubagentStop      | When subagent finishes          | Control subagent completion                       |
       | PreCompact        | Before context compaction       | React to context window cleanup                   |
       | SessionStart      | Session startup/resume          | Load context, setup environment variables         |
       | SessionEnd        | Session termination             | Cleanup, logging, session stats                   |

       3. Configuration Locations (Scope Hierarchy)

       Hooks are configured in settings files with this precedence order:

       1. Enterprise managed policy (highest priority)
       2. Project-local settings: .claude/settings.local.json (not committed)
       3. Project settings: .claude/settings.json (committed)
       4. User settings: ~/.claude/settings.json (lowest priority)
       5. Plugin hooks: Automatically merged from enabled plugins

       4. Hook Execution Formats

       There are two types of hooks:

       A. Command Hooks (Bash Scripts)
       {
         "hooks": {
           "PreToolUse": [
             {
               "matcher": "Bash",
               "hooks": [
                 {
                   "type": "command",
                   "command": "your-bash-command-here",
                   "timeout": 60  // Optional, default 60 seconds
                 }
               ]
             }
           ]
         }
       }

       B. Prompt-Based Hooks (LLM Evaluation)
       {
         "hooks": {
           "Stop": [
             {
               "hooks": [
                 {
                   "type": "prompt",
                   "prompt": "Evaluate if Claude should stop: $ARGUMENTS. Check if all tasks complete.",
                   "timeout": 30  // Optional, default 30 seconds
                 }
               ]
             }
           ]
         }
       }

       5. Enforcing Boundaries and Triggering Actions

       Hooks are PERFECT for governance enforcement:

       Blocking/Enforcement Examples:

       File Protection Hook (prevent edits to sensitive files)
       {
         "hooks": {
           "PreToolUse": [
             {
               "matcher": "Edit|Write",
               "hooks": [
                 {
                   "type": "command",
                   "command": "python3 -c \"import json, sys; data=json.load(sys.stdin); path=data.get('tool_input',{}).get('file_path',''); sys.exit(2 if any(p in path for p in ['.env', 
       'package-lock.json', '.git/']) else 0)\""
                 }
               ]
             }
           ]
         }
       }

       Hook Exit Code Behavior:
       - Exit 0: Success (allow action)
       - Exit 2: Blocking error (deny action, show stderr to Claude)
       - Other exit codes: Non-blocking error

       Permission Decision Control:

       {
         "hookSpecificOutput": {
           "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
           "permissionDecision": "allow|deny|ask",
           "permissionDecisionReason": "Explanation for Claude",
           "updatedInput": { "field": "new_value" }  // Modify tool inputs
         }
       }

       Use Cases for Governance:

       1. Pre-commit validation - Block commits that violate policies
       2. File/directory protection - Prevent modifications to restricted areas
       3. Command auditing - Log all bash commands for compliance
       4. Prompt validation - Block prompts containing sensitive patterns
       5. Automatic formatting - Enforce code style via PostToolUse
       6. Environment setup - SessionStart hooks can load governance context
       7. Intelligent stopping - Use prompt-based Stop hooks with LLM evaluation

       Key Technical Details:

       Matchers (for PreToolUse, PermissionRequest, PostToolUse):
       - Simple strings: Write matches exactly
       - Regex: Edit|Write, Notebook.*
       - Wildcard: * matches all tools
       - MCP tools: mcp__memory__.*, mcp__.*__write.*

       Hook Input Format (via stdin as JSON):
       {
         "session_id": "abc123",
         "transcript_path": "/path/to/conversation.jsonl",
         "cwd": "/current/directory",
         "permission_mode": "default|plan|acceptEdits|bypassPermissions",
         "hook_event_name": "PreToolUse",
         "tool_name": "Write",
         "tool_input": { /* tool-specific input */ }
       }

       Hook Output Format (JSON to stdout or exit code):
       - Exit code 0 = success, allow action
       - Exit code 2 = block action (use stderr for message)
       - JSON output for structured control (hooks specific output formats vary by event)

       Environment Variables Available:
       - CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR: Project root (absolute path)
       - CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE: "true" if running in web environment
       - CLAUDE_ENV_FILE: Available for SessionStart hooks to persist env vars

       Integration with Your Governance Setup:

       Based on your current environment, you can:

       1. Use project-level hooks (.claude/settings.json) for repository-specific governance
       2. Leverage your custom skills together with hooks:
         - /review skill → PreToolUse hooks for file protection
         - /security-review skill → UserPromptSubmit hooks for validation
       3. Use SessionStart hooks to load governance context from CONTEXT.md
       4. Create governance enforcement scripts in .claude/hooks/ directory
